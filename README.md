# Titanic_survivor_prediction
The goal is to predict if a passenger on the Titanic is survived based on provided passenger information. 
This is a classification problem with binary classes survived/not survived as target results. To solve this problem and implement deep learning methods from scratch, I build a neural network in three layers applied with backpropagation algorithm.
This project is completed in 5 sections: Data Cleaning, EDA, Feature Engineering, Data Modeling and Evaluation, Make predictions for submission.
Dataset: train.csv and test.csv
